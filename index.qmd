abstract: |
 In a regional context marked by political crises, persistent inequalities, and episodes of social unrest, understanding the evolution of social cohesion is essential for assessing democratic stability and institutional legitimacy. Although there are numerous studies on the causes and consequences of mistrust or polarization in Latin America, there is still a gap in the systematic and longitudinal analysis of social cohesion as an integral phenomenon. This paper seeks to fill that gap by developing a set of indicators that allow for the analysis of the evolution of the different dimensions of social cohesion with temporal and regional comparability.

 This article seeks to fill these gaps by proposing and validating a measurement model that allows for a comparative, longitudinal, and multilevel analysis of social cohesion in Latin America. Specifically, we seek to advance: (i) a clear and validated operationalization that integrates key dimensions from the existing literature and available data for the region; (ii) the estimation of regional and national trajectories over the last two decades; and (iii) the identification of factors associated with these changes through the application of hybrid multilevel regression models. This is expected to provide robust evidence on changes in the region over the last two decades, contributing to the academic and political discussion on the challenges and opportunities of social cohesion in Latin America.
