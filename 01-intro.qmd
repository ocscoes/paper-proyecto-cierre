# Introduction

Social cohesion has emerged as a critical dimension of societal well-being and democratic stability, particularly in regions experiencing rapid social and political transformation. In Latin America, recent years have been marked by episodes of political instability, persistent inequalities and low economic growth, as well as cycles of social conflict [@undp_trapped_2023; @salazar-xirinachs_repensar_2023]. Social tensions therefore appear to have increased in the region, reflecting a lack of trust in democratic institutions and widespread discontent with corruption and inequality. In this context, social cohesion has climbed the public and academic agendas, with recent diagnoses from both international organizations and national governments warning about its strains and the challenges it poses for democratic governance and inclusive development [@undp_trapped_2023; @salazar-xirinachs_repensar_2023; @castillo_cohesion_2022; @mideso_informe_2020].

Despite its widespread and everyday use in public discussion, defining social cohesion theoretically and operationally remains a challenge. The literature ranges from studies focused on one or several specific dimensions of social cohesion [@ariely_does_2013; @castillo_cohesion_2022; @castillo_social_2023] to efforts to synthesize the phenomenon into comprehensive indices [@langer_conceptualising_2016; @delhey_happier_2016; @delhey_social_2018; @dragolov_social_2013; @janmaat_social_2010]. Such conceptual and methodological heterogeneity makes it difficult to compare countries and to detect transformations over time. Moreover, most of these definitions and their correspondent operationalizations have been tested mainly in European or high-income countries [@ariely_does_2013; @delhey_happier_2016], with only partial references to Latin America [@janmaat_social_2010]. This limitation persists even though evidence suggests that national and regional differences in cultural, historical, and institutional contexts shape the cohesion of societies and the factors that determine it [@janmaat_social_2010; @delhey_happier_2016]. Thus, despite the widespread perception that social cohesion is under strain in Latin American societies,there is a lack of empirical evidence of differences between countries, trends over time, and the factors that explain these changes.

This article has a double aim. On the one hand, and based on previous comprehensive approaches to social cohesion, it seeks to propose and validate a measurement model that enables comparative, longitudinal, and multilevel analysis of social cohesion in Latin America. On the second hand, based on this model, we aim to advance on the estimation of regional and national trajectories over the past two decades, as well as to identufy factors associated with these changes through longitudinal multilevel regression models. This is expected to provide robust evidence on the changes in the region over the last two decades, contributing to the academic and policy discussion on the challenges and opportunities of social cohesion in Latin America.
