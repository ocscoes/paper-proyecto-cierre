# Methodology

## Data

The main source of data for this study is the AmericasBarometer of the [Latin American Public Opinion Project](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/latin-american-public-opinion-project-lapop), also known as the LAPOP Survey. The survey aims to collect data on public opinion about democracy and governance in the Americas. The survey design is probabilistic and representative of the adult population in each country [@lapoplab_americasbarometer_2023].

The survey has been conducted regularly since 2004. To date, nine waves have been carried out, covering between 11 and 23 countries, with a total of over 400,000 interviews in two decades. The questionnaire is administered through face-to-face surveys, with the exception of Canada and the United States.

As a criterion, this study included only those countries in the region that had data available for the main indicators of the study at least five points in time. As summarized in @tbl-paises, this study includes a total of 238,257 individuals nested in 174 country waves in 25 countries in the Americas.

For contextual data on countries, various data sources were used, including:

1) Open data from the World Bank. This contains various indicators on social and economic development for most countries in the world. The data portal is accessible at: [https://datos.bancomundial.org/](https://datos.bancomundial.org/).

2) The World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators. This is a survey of experts that collects data on various governance indicators, covering multiple countries with information updated between 1996 and 2003. The data is available at: [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators).

3) The V-Dem Dataset. It collects a multidimensional set of data that seeks to measure the quality of democracy around the world. The database is accessible through the R package `vdemdata` [@maerz_vdemdata_2025].

## Variables

### Dependent variables

```{r}
#| include: false
library(psych)

# datos_subset <- datos_wide |>
#   select(`Cohesión vertical`,
#          `Cohesión horizontal`)
# 
# alpha(datos_subset)
```


A Social Cohesion Index was constructed, comprising two dimensions which, in turn, are summary indices constructed from LAPOP indicators. The selection of indicators, sub-dimensions, and dimensions is based on previous work at the aggregate level by the Social Cohesion Observatory, accessible here: [https://ocscoes.github.io/medicion-cohesion-LA/](https://ocscoes.github.io/medicion-cohesion-LA/).

The Horizontal Cohesion Index consists of two sub-dimensions: Urban Safety and Interpersonal Trust. Urban Safety includes indicators of objective safety and subjective safety. Interpersonal Trust, meanwhile, is a single indicator of how trustworthy people are in general[¹].

The Vertical Cohesion Index consists of two dimensions: Trust in Institutions and Attitudes toward Democracy. Trust in Institutions includes indicators related to citizens' trust in Congress, the judiciary, and political parties. Attitudes toward Democracy consists of two indicators on support for the democratic system and satisfaction with the functioning of democracy in one's country[²].

The indicators were standardized so that all sub-dimensions and dimensions of the indices have a range from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating low levels of social cohesion and 10 indicating high levels of cohesion.

          "Confianza en las Instituciones" = confianza_inst_ind,
          "Actitudes hacia la democracia" = democracia_ind)

# data <- data %>%

### Independent variables

Economic, institutional, and cultural factors were included as independent variables. Recognizing the hierarchical structure of the data, predictors were considered at the individual level, at the wave-country level, and at the country level.

#### Individual variables

The main individual predictor used in this study is the educational level of individuals. The multiple LAPOP codes for this indicator were unified to create a variable with three categories, distinguishing between individuals with primary, secondary, and tertiary education.

In addition, gender, age, and political position were added as control variables.

#### Contextual variables

Economic prosperity was measured using the logarithm of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) values. Economic inequality was measured using the Gini index. Both indicators were extracted from the World Bank database. In addition, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education in a country was included as a proxy for educational opportunities.

In terms of institutional factors, the Electoral Democracy Index, or polyarchy, was used to measure the democratic quality of countries. On the other hand, a governance index ($\alpha$ = 0.96)  calculated from the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators was included [@kaufmann_worldwide_2024].

Cultural diversity will be measured as the percentage of the migrant population relative to the total population of the country, using data from the World Bank. Given that the series is available every five years, an annual series was constructed by imputing the intermediate years using logistic interpolation.

## Method

### Confirmatory factor analysis

A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the model constructed by the Social Cohesion Observatory [-@observatoriodecohesionsocial_medicion_2025] and the theoretical proposal by @chan_reconsidering_2006. As can be seen in @fig-modelo, social cohesion is understood as a latent construct consisting of two latent dimensions: vertical cohesion and horizontal cohesion.

### Multilevel analysis

Given the hierarchical structure of the data, hybrid multilevel regression models were estimated. This technique allows individual-level data to be used to decompose country-level effects into their components between countries (between effects) and within a country over time (within effects) [@schmidt-catran_random_2016; @fairbrother_two_2014]. The models were estimated using the R package `lme4` [@bates_fitting_2015].

The proposed model could be formally expressed as:

$$
y_{jti} = \beta_{0}(t) + \beta_{1}X_{jti} + \gamma_{we}(Z_{jt}-\bar{Z}_{j}) + \gamma_{be}\bar{Z}_{j} + v_j + u_{jt} + e_{jti}
$$
The model integrates three levels with individuals $i$ nested in waves-countries $t$ nested in countries $j$. $X_{jti}$  represents individual-level variables, while $Z_{jt}$ are contextual variables at the wave-country level. Given that $Z_{jt}$ contains variance at both level 2 and level 3, it was broken down into the average of the variable across all its waves ($\bar{Z}_{j}$) and the intra-country deviation in a given wave ($Z_{jt}-\bar{Z}_{j}$). Thus, $\gamma_{we}$ represents the within effect, that is, the effect of change in a country over time, while $\gamma_{be}$ represents the between effect, that is, the structural differences between countries. In addition, $\beta_{0}(t)$ controls for changes over time not explained by the model. Finally, $v_j$, $u_{jt}$ and $e_{jti}$ represent the errors at the country, wave-country, and individual levels.
